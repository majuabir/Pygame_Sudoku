# Pygame_Sudoku
 Basic implementation of sudoku using Pygame. Also includes a solver.
 To play the game, execute the file "soduku.py". Currently, this program
 only works on one board that is hard-coded into the game. If you wish
 to play on a different board, you will have to manually change the
 starting board values in the script itself.

# Improvements I may never get to implement

 - Allow changes in TILE_SIZE without the display glitching out.
 - Have a way to save scores + time
 - Implement a way to annotate cells
 - Sudoku puzzle generator??
 - Animate solver??
